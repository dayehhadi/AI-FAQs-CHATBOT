        "question": "How are my letter grades converted into a GPA?",
        "answer": "GPAs calculated using letter grades are actuallyweightedGPAs. This means that the letter grade you receive for a course is weighted by the course'scredit ​​value. For example, if you receive a B+ in a course that is a three credit-hour course, your B+ is equivalent to a quality point value of 3.3, and this 3.3 is multiplied by three credit hours for a total of 9.9. If you take a four credit-hour course at the same time, and you earn an A-, this A- is equivalent to 3.7 quality points, and when multiplied by four credit hours results in a total of 14.8. For simplicity's sake, let's say that these were the only courses you took in this particular term, so your GPA would thus be 9.9 + 14.8 / 7 or 3.53. Had your A- course been a three-credit course, the calculation would have been 9.9 + 11.1 / 6 or 3.50. The weighting of the course for which you earned an A- enhances your GPA in the first example. At AUB, GPAs are capped at 4.0.Calculation of GPA in Tabular form:GradeQuality PointsCreditsTotal Quality PointsGPA​Course 1B+3.339.9Course 2A-3.7414.87 (a)24.7 (b)3.53 (b/a)​"

        "question": "I have concerns about data privacy if the quizzes and exams will be proctored remotely.",
        "answer": "AUB takes the issue of data privacy and confidentiality very seriously, as indicated in itsPrivacy Statement​. At the same time, we are all working towards ensuring the continuation of instruction and learning, while preserving AUB's high academic standards and integrity.Remote proctoring of an online exam can be done either via Respondus or a videoconferencing platform, e.g., Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, etc. Your instructor may use a video conferencing platform to proctor an online oral or written exam, but without recording the session. This approach was deemed not to pose a privacy risk higher than that of conducting an online class session using a videoconferencing platform, or that of proctoring an in-person exam.Exams using Respondus are proctored through the combined use of the Respondus LockDown Browser and Respondus Monitor. This automated proctoring produces a recording of each exam session that can then be analyzed after the exam has ended. For technical help on installing Repondus, please contact the Office of Information Technology helpdesk by sending an email to it.helpdesk@aub.edu.lb. The use of Respondus complies with the provisions set in AUB'sPrivacy Statement​​ to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of your personal data.​"
